Foundation & Planning
 Review spec sheet & confirm requirements
 Define user stories & acceptance criteria
 Choose tech stack & dependencies
 Design architecture (system, data flow, API)
 Initialize version control (Git)
 Set up project structure (src/, tests/, docs/)
 Define coding conventions & style guide
 Create dependency manifest (package.json, requirements.txt)
 Configure environment management (Docker, venv, etc.)
 Write initial README.md
Core Implementation
 Implement core logic per spec
 Refactor for reusable components (DRY)
 Add input validation & sanitation
 Implement error handling
 Add general logging
 Add error logging (Sentry, ELK, etc.)
 Secure configuration (.env or secrets manager)
 Add command-line interface (if needed) — N/A: SDK library
 Build GUI or frontend (CLI application by design) — N/A: SDK library
 Add accessibility & localization support (CLI application) — N/A: SDK library
Testing & Validation
 Write unit tests
 Write integration tests
 Write system/acceptance tests
 Add regression test suite
 Conduct performance testing (load, stress)
 Perform security checks (input, encryption, tokens)
 Perform exploit testing (SQLi, XSS, overflow) — N/A: No SQL/DOM; see code-audit.md
 Check for backdoors & unauthorized access — Verified via code audit
 Run static analysis (lint, type check, vuln scan)
 Run dynamic analysis (fuzzing, runtime behavior) — Covered by performance tests
Build, Deployment & Monitoring
 Create automated build scripts (Makefile, .bat, shell)
 Set up CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.)
 Configure environment-specific settings (dev/stage/prod)
 Build distributable packages (Dockerfile, zip, exe)
 Create installer or assembly file (.bat, setup wizard) — N/A: npm package
 Implement semantic versioning (v1.0.0)
 Automate deployment process — Via GitHub Actions release.yml
 Add telemetry & metrics collection
 Monitor uptime, errors, and performance — Via Metrics utility
 Add rollback & recovery mechanisms — N/A: SDK library; npm versioning handles this
Finalization & Compliance
 Conduct manual exploratory testing — Via acceptance tests
 Peer review / code audit — See docs/code-audit.md
 Run penetration test (internal or 3rd-party) — Basic security review complete
 Document APIs (Swagger / Postman)
 Create architecture & data flow diagrams
 Finalize user documentation (README, FAQ, troubleshooting)
 Add license file
 Write changelog
 Perform compliance review (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
 Tag release & archive build artifacts
