        Apple Inc. reported quarterly revenue of $89.5 billion on Tuesday,
        beating analyst expectations of $87.1 billion. CEO Tim Cook announced
        the results during an earnings call, stating that iPhone sales drove
        the majority of growth. The company sold 78 million iPhones during
